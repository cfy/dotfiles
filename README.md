# dotfiles

Just a collection of configuration files I use, and some information about them.



List:
- vim: vimrc
	+ Just a vimrc. It uses no plugins and is based on me relearning vim, for now.
	+ Inspired by a really nice video
	+ [How to do 90% of What Plugins Do(With Just Vim)][no-plugin-video]

- tmux: tmux.conf
	+ Just a tmux.conf. I learned just the basics on the book 
	+ Inspired by a really nice book
	+ [tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development][tmux-book]
