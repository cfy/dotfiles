# dotfiles

Just a collection of configuration files I use, and some information about them.



List:
- vim: *vimrc*, *vim*
	+ Uses [vim-plug][vim-plug]
	+ minimalistic config
	+ has config files in ftplugin folder
	+ Inspired by a really nice video
		* [How to do 90% of What Plugins Do(With Just Vim)][no-plugin-video]
	+ Researching [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][lvsthw]
	+ Took some tips from many people, but really liked [rdegges setup][rdegges]
	+ Now based in XDG Base Directory Specification

- tmux: *tmux.conf*
	+ Just a tmux.conf. I learned just the basics on the book 
	+ Inspired by a really nice book
	+ [tmux: Productive Mouse-Free Development][tmux-book]
	+ So far, simply copy tmux.conf to $HOME/.tmux.conf
	+ **Under construction**
